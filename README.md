### convert.ts

> [!NOTE]  
> Need to clone project and run locally


The `convert.ts` module allows you to convert data to different formats.

- `convertJson(fileName: string, data: any | Country[] | City[])`: Convert data to JSON format and save it to a file.
- `convertCSV(fileName: string, data: any | Country[] | City[])`: Convert data to CSV format and save it to a file.

```javascript
import { convertJson, convertCSV } from './convert.ts';

const data = [{ /* Your data here */ }];
convertJson('data.json', data);
convertCSV('data.csv', data);
```

## Data Files

This utility assumes the presence of data files in JSON format. Ensure you have the required data files in the specified locations before using the utility.

- `countries.json`: Country data file.
- `cities.json`: City data file.

There is also csv files of both countries and cities this is to make it easier to import data to any database as the package size is quite large.
